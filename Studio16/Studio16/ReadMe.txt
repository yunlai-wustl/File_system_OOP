Studio Questions:

3a) This would be an example of interface inheritance because the derived class publicly inherits the base.

3b) These member variables should be private because they should be specific to the TextFile Class rather than be accessible . If we declare it them as public/protected, the derived class will have the contents/name with base class, that's what we don't want to see.

4) We created an object, wrote to that object and read it.

5) We made an object of abstract file type rather than just textfile.
