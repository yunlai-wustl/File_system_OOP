2. In order to test the implementation of the new class, we first tested by writing to our object a proper vector with no weird characters and 
no size-mismatch and we tested it by printing the size before and after writing and also calling the read funciton after the write to see if it printed
the vector's out. Then I tried with weird inputs which resulted in nothing being read and the size being 0. Then I tried with a size mismatch
and similar to beforenothing happened.
